# FASTAPI BACKEND RULES

## Framework Requirements
- Always use FastAPI framework

## Project Organization
- **Router Structure**: Organize endpoints using APIRouter for modular design
- **Dependency Injection**: Use FastAPI's dependency injection for database connections and authentication
- **API Documentation**: Leverage automatic OpenAPI documentation generation

## API Design
- Do not automatically attach a new module with api endpoints, unless specified

## Testing
- **TestClient**: Use FastAPI's TestClient for API endpoint testing
- **Database Testing**: Use test databases for integration testing
- **Authentication Testing**: Test protected endpoints with proper authentication

## Business Logic Architecture
- If a business logic module depends on data-access, queue or other infrastructure, they should be accessed via a module/repository (named: `db_postgres.py`, `db_dynamo.py`, `queue_kafka.py`, etc) to hide implementation details
- Business logic modules should be composed of the modules it depends on and should not use inheritance
- Business logic modules should accept dependencies as parameters to enable testing with mocks
- For initial development, do not add a separate factory module for the business logic modules

## Data Model Strategy
- Reuse persistence layer models (like SQLModel objects) as modules interface objects when possible; otherwise transform objects only when necessary
- If a module obviously uses another module's model, try reusing the other module's model as an interface object
- We might also check and consider if there's some overlap in these modules
