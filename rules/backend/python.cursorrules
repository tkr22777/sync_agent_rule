# PYTHON BACKEND RULES

## Framework Requirements
- Always use Python 3.12+
- Use Poetry for dependency management
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Always use type hints while generating code

## Project Structure
- **Virtual Environments**: Always use virtual environments for dependency isolation
- **Dependency Management**: Use requirements.txt or poetry.lock for reproducible builds
- **Code Quality**: Follow PEP 8 standards and use automated formatting tools

## Workflow and Verification
- Make small, incremental changes and verify them through: starting the server/application, curl requests, etc
- Do not create a throwaway script to test the changes
- Do not add extra code as part of the core functionality
- If needed, test functionality by running the server and triggering the execution path
- Run test suite on dependent modules at the end to avoid any regression

## Codebase Organization
- For each module have separate pydantic settings file that reads environment variables specific to that module from the .env file
- Do not use load_dotenv to load environment variables
- Avoid over-commenting; docstrings only when intent is non-obvious or business-critical
- Do not add multi-line docstrings with Google-style docstring format, they make it very lengthy to fast browse and read code
- Only use single line docstrings if needed for complex business logic
- Always use good function, class, and module names, and use type hints such that the code is self-documenting

## Configuration Management
- Use pydantic settings with ENV instead of using load_dotenv to load environment variables (this is creating a tight coupling between the modules and the settings file)

## Testing Strategy
- Place tests under `tests/` directory mirroring the package paths
- **Unit Testing**: Use pytest for comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Testing**: Test database connections and external API integrations
- **Mocking**: Use appropriate mocking for external dependencies

## Exception Handling
- Do not suppress exceptions, handle exceptions explicitly:
  - Re-raise them with appropriate context
  - Log them with sufficient detail before taking recovery actions
  - Transform them into more specific application exceptions
  - Use context managers or try-except-finally blocks to ensure proper resource cleanup

## Import Management
- Avoid optional imports with try-except blocks
- If a feature is incomplete, use stub implementations with TODO comments rather than conditional imports
- Do not use optional imports with try-except blocks. All modules should be directly imported
- At any given time, the source code should not have conditional imports or optional feature flags based on import availability

## Business Logic Architecture
- Business-logic modules must be testable; dependencies should be injectable or mockable via dependency-injection patterns
- Separate the data-access layer from business logic. A (business) logic module should compose (instead of inherit) data-access modules and other business-logic modules
- Create Pydantic data models in separate files and organize them alongside their corresponding business logic
- When models are shared between business logic and data access layers, use a single definition to avoid duplication
- For codes that can be reused, create stateless utility functions that are independent of self-hosted infrastructure and don't modify system state

## Data Models
- Keep pydantic models in separate files from business logic implementations
- Keep pydantic models in the module as their related business logic
- Do not add descriptions to pydantic model fields, they should be self-documenting
- If an object is not stored in a persistence layer, only use pydantic models
