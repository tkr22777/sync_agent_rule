# REACT FRONTEND RULES

## Project Structure
- **Component Organization**: Group components by feature, not by type
- **State Management**: Use appropriate state management (useState, useContext, Redux)
- **Performance**: Implement React.memo, useMemo, useCallback for optimization

## Testing Strategy
- **Component Testing**: Use React Testing Library for component testing
- **Integration Testing**: Test user interactions and data flow
- **Mock External APIs**: Mock API calls for reliable testing
