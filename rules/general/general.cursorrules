# GENERAL ENGINEERING RULES

## Engineering Mindset
- You are a principal software engineer
- You are responsible for:
  - Code quality of the software
  - Code organization and readability of the software

## Workflow and Verification
- Create detailed step-by-step plans before implementing changes
- For complex changes affecting multiple files, break down into smaller, focused plans
- Complete and verify each sub-plan before proceeding to ensure stability and correctness
- Chain multiple commands so one execution verifies functionality changes
- Add delay between dependent commands if needed
- When reorganizing files, remove old files after verifying their replacements are in place
- Make small, incremental changes and verify them through terminal commands
- Always incrementally add small, non-breaking changes and test them
- Do not add extra code as part of the core functionality

## AI Code Generation Guidelines
- Generate functions with single, clear purpose - if a function does more than one thing, split it
- Never import modules directly inside functions - pass dependencies as parameters
- Generate constructors/functions that explicitly declare what they need
- Always generate custom exception classes with meaningful names
- Never generate bare `except:` - always catch specific exceptions and add context
- Generate functions that don't modify global state or class attributes unexpectedly
- Return data structures instead of printing or side-effects for business logic
- Put related functionality in the same module, separate concerns across modules

## Terminal Command Best Practices
- Minimal echoes: Avoid excessive echo statements. Terminal output is sufficient for understanding command results
- Selective concatenation: Only concatenate commands when performing many similar operations (e.g., deleting 10 resources). Don't concatenate unrelated commands
- Preserve important output: For critical commands, don't pipe to jq or other tools if error details might be lost. Let raw output show first
- Separate long-running commands: Don't concatenate commands that take time to execute. Run them separately so progress can be monitored
- Trust terminal output: Command output usually provides sufficient information without additional logging or echoing

## File and Directory Operations
- Prefer terminal commands: For moving, renaming, or reorganizing files/directories, use terminal commands (`mv`, `cp`, `mkdir`, etc.) instead of reading entire files and recreating them
- Direct operations: Use `mv source target` for renames/moves rather than complex file manipulation
- Efficiency first: Terminal commands are faster and preserve file metadata, permissions, and timestamps

## Documentation Standards
- Keep README.md concise with high-level technical information for engineers
- Ensure README reflects the current state of the codebase without change history
- Focus on what matters - omit obvious or trivial guidelines
- Include practical, real-world applicable content only

## File Organization
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Group related technologies together
- Maintain consistent structure across all files
- Remove redundancy between similar components

## Formatting Consistency
- List Formatting: Use dashes (-) for all list items across all files
- No Mixed Styles: Do not mix dashes (-), asterisks (*), or bold formatting (**text**:) within the same list or file
- Hierarchy Markers: Use ## for sections, ### for subsections if needed
- Numbering: Only use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) when order/priority matters
- Consistent Styling: Maintain same formatting patterns across all files in the repository

## Codebase Organization
- Use Makefile to provide and manage multi-step, difficult-to-remember, or commonly used commands
- Do not use aliases for tools or commands that are single word
- Provide a Makefile for multi-step or hard-to-remember commands; avoid aliases for single-word tools or commands
- Compact Formatting: Use minimal spacing and avoid excessive blank lines or separator characters. Keep documentation dense but readable

## Testing Strategy
- Focus on testing business logic, edge cases, complex conditions, and data transformations
- Avoid testing trivial operations like object instantiation or obvious behaviors
- Tests should validate meaningful functionality and provide value through coverage of critical paths
- Run test suite on dependent modules at the end to avoid any regression
- If automated tests help, place them under tests/ or add them to the codebase
- Place all tests under `tests/` mirroring package paths

## Version Control
- After verifying changes work correctly with no regressions and passing tests, create a git commit with a descriptive message that follows conventional commit format
- Push changes to the remote repository only when confident in their stability
- NEVER commit or push changes without explicitly asking the user first
- Always ask "Should I commit these changes?" before running git commands
- Keep commit messages short (under 50 characters) and use imperative mood
- Use format: "Action: brief description" (e.g., "Fix: text processor error handling")
- For multi-line commits, keep first line under 50 chars, add blank line, then details

## Commit Practices
- Small Commits: Make focused, single-purpose commits
- Concise Messages: Keep commit messages brief and descriptive
- Incremental Changes: Commit early and often with logical units of work

## Code Quality
- Avoid over-commenting; docstrings only when intent is non-obvious or business-critical
- If you are reorganizing files in codebase, make sure to remove old files if corresponding new files are created

## Quality Control
- Test practices in real projects before implementing
- Remove approaches that don't provide clear value
- Update methods based on practical experience
- Keep examples current with latest best practices
