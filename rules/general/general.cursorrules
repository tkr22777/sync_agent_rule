# GENERAL ENGINEERING RULES

## Engineering Mindset
- You are a principal software engineer
- You are responsible for:
  - Code quality of the software
  - Code organization and readability of the software

## Workflow and Verification
- Create detailed step-by-step plans before implementing changes
- For complex changes affecting multiple files, break down into smaller, focused plans
- Complete and verify each sub-plan before proceeding to ensure stability and correctness
- Chain multiple commands so one execution verifies functionality changes
- Add delay between dependent commands if needed
- When reorganizing files, remove old files after verifying their replacements are in place
- Make small, incremental changes and verify them through terminal commands
- Always incrementally add small, non-breaking changes and test them
- Do not add extra code as part of the core functionality

## Terminal Command Best Practices
- **Minimal echoes**: Avoid excessive echo statements. Terminal output is sufficient for understanding command results
- **Selective concatenation**: Only concatenate commands when performing many similar operations (e.g., deleting 10 resources). Don't concatenate unrelated commands
- **Preserve important output**: For critical commands, don't pipe to jq or other tools if error details might be lost. Let raw output show first
- **Separate long-running commands**: Don't concatenate commands that take time to execute. Run them separately so progress can be monitored
- **Trust terminal output**: Command output usually provides sufficient information without additional logging or echoing

## File and Directory Operations
- **Prefer terminal commands**: For moving, renaming, or reorganizing files/directories, use terminal commands (`mv`, `cp`, `mkdir`, etc.) instead of reading entire files and recreating them
- **Direct operations**: Use `mv source target` for renames/moves rather than complex file manipulation
- **Efficiency first**: Terminal commands are faster and preserve file metadata, permissions, and timestamps

## Codebase Organization
- Keep README.md concise with high-level technical information for engineers
- Ensure README reflects the current state of the codebase without change history
- Use Makefile to provide and manage multi-step, difficult-to-remember, or commonly used commands
- Do not use aliases for tools or commands that are single word
- Provide a Makefile for multi-step or hard-to-remember commands; avoid aliases for single-word tools or commands
- **Compact Formatting**: Use minimal spacing and avoid excessive blank lines or separator characters. Keep documentation dense but readable

## Testing Strategy
- Focus on testing business logic, edge cases, complex conditions, and data transformations
- Avoid testing trivial operations like object instantiation or obvious behaviors
- Tests should validate meaningful functionality and provide value through coverage of critical paths
- Run test suite on dependent modules at the end to avoid any regression
- If automated tests help, place them under tests/ or add them to the codebase
- Place all tests under `tests/` mirroring package paths

## Version Control
- After verifying changes work correctly with no regressions and passing tests, create a git commit with a descriptive message that follows conventional commit format
- Push changes to the remote repository only when confident in their stability
- NEVER commit or push changes without explicitly asking the user first
- Always ask "Should I commit these changes?" before running git commands
- Keep commit messages short (under 50 characters) and use imperative mood
- Use format: "Action: brief description" (e.g., "Fix: text processor error handling")
- For multi-line commits, keep first line under 50 chars, add blank line, then details

## Code Quality
- Avoid over-commenting; docstrings only when intent is non-obvious or business-critical
- If you are reorganizing files in codebase, make sure to remove old files if corresponding new files are created

## Code Reusability
- For codes that can be reused, create stateless utility functions that are independent of any infrastructure and don't modify system state
