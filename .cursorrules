# CURSOR RULES FOR SYNC_AGENT_RULE PROJECT

## Project Philosophy
- Concise but Complete: Include only essential information that loses meaning without specificity
- Actionable over Verbose: Every rule should be immediately actionable by developers
- Hierarchical Organization: Structure from universal → language → framework → project-specific

## Documentation Standards
- README: Keep summarized, target software engineers, highlight key concepts only
- Rule Files: Focus on what matters - omit obvious or trivial guidelines
- Examples: Include practical, real-world applicable rules only

## Rule Creation Guidelines
- Essential Information Only: Include details that change behavior or prevent errors
- Avoid Generic Advice: Skip basic programming principles everyone knows
- Technology-Specific Focus: Include rules that are specific to the technology stack
- Workflow Integration: Rules should integrate into actual development workflow

## Rule Extraction and Processing
- Complete Content Audit: After extracting rules from example files, conduct comprehensive audit comparing original content against organized rules
- Missing Content Identification: Systematically check for critical sections that may have been overlooked during initial extraction
- Technology-Specific Completeness: Ensure all domain-specific patterns (security, cost optimization, validation) are captured
- Cross-Reference Verification: Compare processed files against organized rules to identify gaps
- Expert Review Approach: Apply domain expertise lens to identify critical missing patterns for each technology stack
- Post-Processing Validation: Always perform final completeness check before considering extraction complete

## Content Categorization Standards
- Universal vs Specific: Properly categorize universal patterns in general rules, technology-specific patterns in appropriate domains
- Avoid Duplication: Move shared patterns to appropriate general categories rather than duplicating across specific rule files
- Logical Grouping: Place infrastructure-specific reusability in backend rules, AI code generation patterns in general rules
- Hierarchical Placement: Ensure rules are placed at the most appropriate level of the hierarchy

## File Organization
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Group related technologies together
- Maintain consistent structure across all rule files
- Remove redundancy between similar rule sets

## Formatting Consistency
- List Formatting: Use dashes (-) for all list items across all rule files
- No Mixed Styles: Do not mix dashes (-), asterisks (*), or bold formatting (**text**:) within the same list or file
- Hierarchy Markers: Use ## for sections, ### for subsections if needed
- Numbering: Only use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) when order/priority matters
- Consistent Styling: Maintain same formatting patterns across all rule files in the repository
- Format Verification: Check all rule files for formatting consistency before committing changes

## Commit Practices
- Small Commits: Make focused, single-purpose commits
- Concise Messages: Keep commit messages brief and descriptive
- Incremental Changes: Commit early and often with logical units of work

## Quality Control
- Test rules in real projects before adding
- Remove rules that don't provide clear value
- Update rules based on practical experience
- Keep examples current with latest best practices
